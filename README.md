## ☎️ Phone Book Tutorial

This project consists of two microservices: `contact` and `report`.

Inter-service communication is handled via **RabbitMQ** with **MassTransit**. When a user initiates a report request through the `contact` service, a message is sent to RabbitMQ. The `report` service listens for this message, retrieves the contact data, and generates the report accordingly.

### ✅ Code Coverage Report

The `coverage-report` folder in the root directory contains the **automatically generated test coverage results** for this project. This folder is created after running unit tests with coverage enabled.

#### 📁 Folder Contents

- `index.html` – The main entry point to the coverage report. Open this file in your browser to view a detailed, visual summary of code coverage.
- Additional subfolders and assets – These support the rendering of the coverage report UI and are generated by the coverage tool (e.g., ReportGenerator).
